# Keyboard Shortcuts

--- 
This repository contains all my electronic books, which are categorized based 
on the programming languages and usability. It might be some of the books have 
copyright as most of these are downloaded from the public links (and owner of 
those books, can send email to remove that book from this repository, and I'll 
remove that one) and for personal learning only, so if anyone either downloads 
or uses this repository AS IT IS with their own responsibility.
