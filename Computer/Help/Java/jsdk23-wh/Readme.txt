Hello !

To use this Winhelp version of JSDK 2.3 documentation,
unzip the file, and double click on Jsdk23.hlp.

Putting a shortcut to Jsdk23.hlp in your Start menu is
a good idea...

Use the icon as you like (i.e. change the shortcut icon).

To build yourself WinHelp documents from HTML files, get HtmlToHlp,
the tool I used to make this one. It's available from the above URL.

Many thanks to Piet Jonas (jonas@physik.uni-greifswald.de) for his excellent 
GIF to Windows BMP conversion Java class.
