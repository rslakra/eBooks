<P>Although users may be the reason for the existence of your UNIX system, they also can be the sysadmin's worst nightmare. Users are always making demands and changing things. The one thing that remains constant is that users come and go, but the system 
remains.

<BR></P>

<P>As system administrator, you will have to add and remove users from the system. It is also your task to provide the default environment so users can get their jobs done. This chapter shows what makes up a user's account, how to create new user accounts, 

and what to do when a user leaves and his account must be removed.

<BR></FONT></A></CENTER></H3>

<P>Users see UNIX as a home directory and a shell. Behind the scenes are many other files and parameters that affect the user. This section explains each part of the user's account and how it affects the user.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>The User's Home Directory</B>

<BR></FONT></A></CENTER></H4>

<P>Every process in UNIX has a current directory. This is no different for the login shell for a user. The initial current directory for a login shell is called its home directory. The login program sets the HOME environment variable to the full pathname 
to this directory. It is in this directory that the login shell looks for its start-up files. It is also in this directory that system daemons look for the following:

<BR></P>

<UL>

<LI>.Xauthority&#151;the processes that are allowed to access the X screen being used by this user.

<BR>

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>.forward&#151;mail redirection file. In this file you place the address or addresses to forward your mail. It allows you to receive mail from many accounts on a single account, or to pass your mail through a program to filter it before reading it.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>.history&#151;holds the last set of commands you executed in the shell for use in the history shell command.

<BR>

<BR></LI></UL>

<P>Regardless of where the alias file resides, it consists of lines containing the alias and the mail address to use for mail received for that alias. Aliases are checked before local user names when mail is being delivered, so you can even alias a local 
user name to a different machine or user. Listing 36.1 is a small excerpt from a mail alias file. It has the required postmaster alias and some local aliases.

These aliases let someone be addressed by their full name, without the sender knowing the user name. Since aliases are 

case insensitive, it doesn't matter how you list the full name. Remember, however, that delivery addresses (the part after the colon) are case sensitive.

<BR></NOTE>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<P>An alias can point to another alias. Aliases listed in this file are systemwide, and are addresses to which another user can reply. This is not true of private aliases users might enter into their mail reader's start-up files.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>The Shell Start-up Files</B>

<BR></FONT></A></CENTER></H4>

<P>Each user interacts with UNIX via a command shell. The command shells use a file in the user's home directory to customize themselves for each user. As administrator, it is your responsibility to provide a default shell customization file. There are two 

different sets of customization files&#151;the one you use depends on the shell family being used. For shells that are derived from /bin/sh the initialization file is .profile, with the Korn shell using an additional file whose name is user definable, but 

is often called .ksh_env. Shells derived from Berkeley's C-shell use .login and .cshrc. A short explanation of the purpose and contents of these 4 files is as follows:

<BR></P>

<UL>

<LI>.profile

<BR>

<BR>This is the start-up file executed by Bourne (/bin/sh) and Korn (/bin/ksh) shells at login. This is the file where you place changes to environment variables and global settings. This file is executed after /etc/profile is executed.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>.ksh_env

<BR>

<BR>The Bourne shell does not have a start-up file for non&#151;login-level shells. The Korn shell does, as it supports aliases and functions that are not exported from the login shell to subshells. If the login shell, via the .profile file, exports the 
variable ENV, each Korn shell will read the file named in that environment variable on start-up. This file should not include changes to environment variables, but should include function and alias definitions. For login shells, this file is run after 
/etc/profile and .profile. For subshells, it is the only file executed.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>.login

<BR>

<BR>This file is run only at login by the C-shell. It should contain environment variable and global settings. It is executed after /etc/cshrc and .cshrc are executed.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>.cshrc

<BR>

<BR>This file is run by all C-shells at start-up. It is used to initialize aliases and local variables. Changes to environment variables should not be made in this file. For login shells, this file is run after /etc/cshrc and before .login. For subshells, 

it is the only file executed.

<P>This is a one- to eight-character alphanumeric field that represents the user's login name. Traditionally the name is all lowercase characters. Any value may be used for this field. To make it easy to tell a user name from a user ID, the name should not

UUCP accounts are an example of the latter. To make it easy to spot accounts that are used by other computers to log in for uucp

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Password (if Not Using a Shadow Password Scheme)</B>

<BR></FONT></A></CENTER></H5>

<P>The users password, encrypted with a one-way cipher is stored in the second field. Only the first 8 characters of the password are used. These are mixed with a 2-character salt to produce a 13-character encrypted password. When it is necessary to 
compare a password, the plain text is encrypted with the salt, and a comparison is made against the encrypted version. If the passwd field is empty, this account has no password, and none is required to log in.

<BR></P>

<P>On systems that support password aging and place the password in the passwd file, the password data can be followed by a comma and four characters that describe the aging information. Each of these characters is drawn from the following character set:

<BR></P>

<UL>

<LI>. = 0

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>/ = 1

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>a&#151;z = 38&#151;63

<BR>

<BR></LI></UL>

<P>The first character after the comma denotes the maximum number of weeks the password is valid. The second character is the minimum number of weeks required between password changes. If both of these characters are zero (..), the user is forced to change 

his password the next time he logs in. If the change interval is larger than the valid interval, only the root user can change the password.

<BR></P>

<P>The remaining two characters are the number of weeks since the epoch when the password was last changed. In UNIX, the current epoch, or beginning of time, is January 1, 1970, 00:00 GMT.

<P>UNIX internally uses a numeric ID to refer to a user. This is the user ID field of the passwd file. It is a number in the range 0&#151;32767 on older systems, 0&#151;65535 on some systems, and 0&#151;2147483648 on SVR4 systems. The number 0 is reserved 

for the root user, the user with special privileges. Many networked systems save -1 for no access and -2 for nobody.

On systems that did not handle sign extension correctly in the user ID, any user ID that mapped to a negative value caused a 
security hole due to other assumptions those systems made about checking. They have been replaced by positive values for noaccess and nobody.

<BR>

<BR>noaccess is the value to use when a file is to be made so that it is not owned by root, but no one will be able to access it. nobody is used by NFS. Remote users with the ID 0 (root) are mapped to the nobody ID on NFS accesses unless the file system is 

exported with root access permission. See Chapter 37, &quot;Networking,&quot; for more details.

<BR>

<BR>UNIX has several accounts that are required. These all have low numbered IDs. It's wise to reserve all the IDs below 100 for these reserved system accounts.

<BR>

<BR>In addition, there are several accounts that are for nonhuman use. These include UUCP access accounts and file ownership accounts. (A file ownership account is one that has no person associated with it, but is designed to hold the ownership of a set of 

files for a department. Then when changes to those files need to be made, any member of the department can su to that user to make the changes.

<BR>

<BR>Consider breaking the numbering space apart into the following:

<BR>

<UL>

<LI>Restricted accounts&#151;system use: 0&#151;99

<BR></LI>

<LI>Networkwide user accounts&#151;100&#151;19999

<BR></LI>

<LI>System restricted user accounts&#151;20000&#151;29999 (These are still unique on the network, but the account is valid only on one system.)

<BR></LI>

<LI>UUCP access accounts&#151;30000&#151;30999

<BR></LI>

<LI>File ownership accounts&#151;31000&#151;31999

<BR></LI>

<LI>nobody&#151;32000

<BR></LI>

<LI>noaccess&#151;32001

<BR></LI></UL>

Of course, if you need more accounts than this scheme supports, and if your system supports extended user IDs, move the regions around to make them bigger.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>-e expire&#151;This is the ending date for this login. This field is not required, and if omitted no expiration date will be used. The date is converted from the input format to the days since January 1, 1970, and placed in the /etc/shadow file. Any 
input date format except a Julian date can be used. For example:

<BR>

<BR>-e &quot;January 1, 1995&quot; or -e 1/1/95

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>-f inactive&#151;This is the maximum number of days this login can be inactive before being invalidated. It is stored in the number of days inactive field of the /etc/shadow file. If this argument is omitted, no checking for inactivity is performed.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>-g group&#151;This is the primary group ID field of the /etc/passwd file. Either a group name or a numeric ID may be supplied.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>-G group [, group .\x11.\x11.     ]&#151;These are the secondary groups. The user's name is added to each of these group entries in the /etc/group file. Again, either a name or a numeric ID may be supplied.

<PRE>passwd -l user</PRE>

<BR>

<BR>Make sure the user is not logged on anywhere in the network. If so, he could use the passwd command to re-enable his login.

<BR>

<BR>Remove or move to another name the .rhosts file in his home directory to prevent him from logging in as himself from another system.

<BR>

<BR>Check the system to make sure there are no setuid programs with his user ID. This can be done with the command

<BR>

<BR>find / -user user_name -perm -04000 -print

<BR>

<BR>Any of these files should be modified to clear the setuid bit. If a production application requires these files to have this bit set, have someone verify that these files are not a security risk.

<BR>

<BR>Remember to run the find command on every system in the network.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Cleaning Up Disk Space Assigned to This User</B>

<BR></FONT></A></CENTER></H4>

<P>After the user's login has been disabled, you need to clean up after him. This takes four steps:

<BR></P>

<OL>

<LI>Find files owned by this user.

<BR>

<BR>The find command traverses the file systems and prints the names of all files owned by this user. The ones in the user's home directory tree may be obvious, but there often are others elsewhere in the hierarchy. For example

<BR>

<BR>find / -user user_name -print

<BR>

<BR>prints a listing of the names of all the files owned by the user user_name. This should be run on each system in the network.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Back up the files to tape.

<BR>

<BR>In case you make a mistake, or there is a question later, make a tape backup of all of this user's files.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Reassign the ownership of files you desire to retain.

<BR>

<BR>This is performed with the chown command.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Remove the remaining files you wish to discard.

<BR>

<BR>You can use the xargs command with the files left on the list after you have deleted all the ones you reassigned ownership with the command

<BR>

<BR>xargs rm &lt; remaining_list

<BR></LI></OL>

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Final User Removal After All Files Are Handled</B>

<BR></FONT></A></CENTER></H4>

<P>When you are sure you no longer need to access this user ID, because all the files have been handled and the home directory is removed, it's time to make the remaining password entry totally unusable by any shell program.

<BR></P>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<NOTE>

<IMG SRC="caution.gif" tppabs="http://www.mcp.com/814665600/0-672/0-672-30402-3/caution.gif" WIDTH = 37 HEIGHT = 35><B>CAUTION: </B>After you do this you will be unable to su to this user ID, so be sure you really do not need to be this user anymore before clearing the entry.

<BR></NOTE>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<P>To make sure that the password entry is only used as a uid placeholder, four fields in the entry should be changed:

<BR></P>

<UL>

<LI>User name&#151;While the user name is available, it can still receive mail. This can cause any mail being received for this now-deleted user to clutter up your mail spool directory. Changing the user name will cause any mail received for this user to 
bounce back to the sender.

<BR>

<BR>So that you know the entry is now a placeholder, use a pattern for the login name, perhaps d_uid, to indicate that this is a deleted entry for <I>uid uid.</I>

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>GCOS (comment/full name)&#151;Update the full name field to show when this entry was deleted. Leave the old user's name in there so you know who it belonged to when files are recovered that have this owner ID.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Home directory&#151;To prevent logging in to this user, set the login directory to a known nonexistent directory. This will prevent others from using su to use this user ID.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Login shell&#151;Finally, change the shell to /usr/bin/false. This will also prevent any accesses by remote commands for this user. This is accomplished with the usermod command:

<BR>

<BR>usermod -l d_100 -c &quot;Syd Weinstein, deleted 4/1/94 by ssw&quot;\

<BR> -d /nodir -s /usr/bin/false syd

<BR>

<BR></LI></UL>

<P>The last step is to remove this user from any mail aliases to which he was a member. This is done by editing the alias file and searching for all occurrences of the user name. Remember also to remove occurrences of alternatives to his name listed in the 

alias file.

<BR></P>

<P>When the backups have rolled around, such that there are no longer any tapes from when this user was around, and you are sure you will never need the ID again, you can remove the placeholder from the /etc/passwd file to reduce the clutter in that file.

<BR></P>

<P>Dealing with user accounts is much easier once you know where everything is located. This chapter shows you where the UNIX system keeps the information on the user's account. With this information you can decide which options to the useradd, usermod, 
groupadd, and groupmod commands you need to use. You can even decide if you need to directly edit the files and go around these commands (but be cautious if you do so!).

<BR></P>

<P>The new user's account starts with the skeleton. It's from the skeleton that the initial contents of his home directory are created. You have to create the skeleton to meet your local needs. A simple default is delivered with the UNIX system, but it is 

up to you to modify that to fit local conventions.

<BR></P>

<P>Finally, eventually you need to remove users. This chapter gives a set of steps you can follow when that becomes necessary.
