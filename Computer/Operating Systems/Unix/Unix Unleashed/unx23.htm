<P>Meet tbl, the troff and nroff table preprocessor.

<BR></P>

<P>tbl is not a popular troff tool. It is cursed and vilified and mocked, but it is used. The people who hate tbl rarely take the time to learn even the basics of formatting a table. Instead, they have two or three reliable samples that they just keep 
copying over and over, changing the data each time. When something goes wrong, they ask a friend or a colleague&#151;maybe even an enemy&#151;for help.

<BR></P>

<P>You don't have to do that. tbl isn't that hard to learn. As with all UNIX utilities and programs, you can learn as much or as little as you like. You can learn the rudiments of tbl in an hour. This chapter includes some sample tables to enlarge your 
collection.

<BR></P>

<BR></FONT></A></CENTER></H3>

<P>tbl is a troff preprocessor. This means that the tbl code you write is processed by tbl before troff gets anywhere near it. Typically, you send a file through tbl and pipe the output to troff. The syntax is

<BR></FONT></A></CENTER></H4>

<P>troff recognizes tbl output by the macros that begin and end a table: .TS and .TE. (The .TS H and .TH macros are discussed in the &quot;Column Headings&quot; section later in this chapter.)

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Minimal Format Options</B>

<BR></FONT></A></CENTER></H4>

<P>In addition to the macros, a table must include at least one line of format options. These options tell tbl whether you want your columns left-justified, centered, or right-justified&#151;in short, how you want each column to look. The rule is one 
option per column. Therefore, a three-column table with all columns left-justified has the following format options:

<BR></P>

<PRE>l l l.</PRE>

<P>The last line of format options must end with a period.

<BR></P>

<P>These are the minimum options you need for a three-column table. With these options, every row in your table has left-justified columns. If you want centered column headings with left-justified data, then you need two rows of format options:

<BR></P>

<PRE>c c c

l l l.</PRE>

<P>tbl uses the first format line to format the first row of your table. It uses the second format line to format the second row of your table. When it runs out of format lines, as it does in row 3 in this example, tbl formats the rest of your table 
according to the last format line.

<BR></P>

<P>You can't format a complex table with the bare minimum; you need to use more of the options that tbl provides.

<BR></P>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">

<CENTER><A ID="I7" NAME="I7">

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Table Data</B>

<BR></FONT></A></CENTER></H4>

<P>Table data is entered with a tab between each column. If a line is too long for your terminal and, therefore, wraps, you can use the continuation character (\). Each new line starts a new row in the table.

<BR></P>

<P>To leave a cell empty, use a tab. For example, to enter a row that contains no entries in the first, second, and fourth columns but contains an entry in the third column, do this:

<BR></P>

<PRE>[TAB][TAB]entry</PRE>

<P>You don't need to enter the last tab&#151;the one for the fourth column. tbl doesn't mind if you specify too little data. It complains only if you specify too much.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Global Options</B>

<BR></FONT></A></CENTER></H4>

<P>tbl's global options affect the placement of your table on the page and its appearance. They are specified on a single line that ends with a semicolon (;). The options must be separated by spaces, tabs, or commas.

<BR></P>

<P>One global option, for example, enables you to change the default column separator, the tab, to another character. The exclamation point is typically used in technical writing. Because there's nothing to get excited about in the text, tbl doesn't get 
confused.

<BR></P>

<P>The global options are

<P>allbox</P>

<P>delim(<I>xy</I>)</P>

<TD>

<P>Uses x and y as eqn delimiters. (eqn is discussed in Chapter 24, &quot;Formatting Equations with eqn.&quot;)</P></TABLE>

<P>The center and expand options are straightforward and do exactly what you would expect.

<BR></P>

<P>By default, tables are left-justified. The center option centers your table with respect to the defined line length. The table might not always look centered. It depends on what indents are used before the table and after it. You can use .in with a 
positive or negative value to adjust the horizontal placement of the table. Remember, though, to reset the indent that comes after the table.

<BR></P>

<P>The reasons for using expand are less obvious. expand makes the width of your table equal to the defined line length. You might want to do this for a special effect. It also comes in handy if you're working with a custom macro package that has outdented 

headings with text indented an inch or more. expand enables you to take advantage of the unused left margin.

<BR></P>

Processing doesn't stop, though. The table is printed. Chances are, though, that it will be too wide. tbl does not respect 
margins. You can often use this feature to your advantage, however.

<BR></NOTE>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<P>tbl provides three global options that you you can use to draw boxes around tables. Figure 23.1 shows an example of each option.

<BR></P>

<P>

<BR><B><A HREF="23unx01.gif" tppabs="http://www.mcp.com/814665600/0-672/0-672-30402-3/23unx01.gif">Figure 23.1.  The </B><B><I>box</I></B><B> options.</A></B>

<BR></P>

<P>allbox is useful when you have many narrow columns (perhaps with numeric data). The lines make the table easier to read. In most other situations, the lines are distracting and unattractive.

<BR></P>

<P>The tab option enables you to specify a different character as the column separator. Many people do this routinely. Just be careful to choose a character that doesn't appear in your table.

<BR></P>

<P>There is a benefit to changing the tab character to a single character such as # or !. If your input line is long, you might exceed the wrap margin, and your input line will become two lines. If you then join the two lines, your tab turns into a space. 

If you change the space to a tab, the line might split again. This is annoying. It is also less likely to happen if you are using # or !. # and ! are single characters, not 4 to 8 characters like the tab.

<BR></P>

<P>The linesize option affects all the lines in your table. If you use it to draw a heavy box around the whole table, you must adjust the point size for internal lines.

<BR></P>

<P>If your table contains equations, you can set the eqn delimiters in a tbl global option. These delimiters must not appear elsewhere in the table, except as eqn delimiters. They also can't be the same as the tab character. (Refer to Chapter 24, 
&quot;Formatting Equations with eqn,&quot; for more information.)

<P>Because tbl right-justifies text blocks, you might want to turn off adjustment inside the text blocks, as in the previous example. Use .na to do this.

<P>The number of text blocks that can be used within a single table varies, depending on the tbl version. If you're using a recent version, don't worry about this. Even if you're using an old version, don't worry. tbl will complain loudly if you use too 
many text blocks. Your only remedy is to break the table into smaller tables.

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<P>Text blocks complicate a table. The first time you use them, you're almost certain to leave out the beginning or ending T-brace or to use an opening brace instead of a closing one. If you do this, tbl assumes your unmatched T-brace is data and prints

<P>If you have some two-line column heads and some one-line column heads, the allbox global option looks really awful. Similarly, if you've spanned any column, allbox doesn't work correctly. You can insert vertical lines between columns by using the pipe

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Troubleshooting</B>

<BR></FONT></A></CENTER></H3>

<P>When you use tbl, keep the following points in mind:

<BR></P>

<UL>

<LI>Don't use macros in tables. They don't get digested properly. It's tempting to put in a .P. You do it without thinking, but often a single .P can wreck your table. Don't try to embed lists in tables. At the very least, don't try it when you're on a 
tight deadline. Macros and tables don't mix.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Don't mix your font changes. If you use B in a format option line to get bold text, don't use f2 for italics. However, escape sequences in your table data are fine. Likewise, don't use macros.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>If you can't get the a format option to work, indent with \0. \0 inserts a space the width of a numeral.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>A common source of error in tables is a space after a T-brace. For some reason, it really makes tables crazy. The space is invisible, too, so you don't see it.

<BR>

<BR></LI></UL>

You can count them to see whether you've put in too many. 

list also puts the line end symbol ($) at the end of each line in the file. A space between T{ and $ is easy to see. To turn list off, use :se nolist.

<BR></NOTE>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<UL>

<LI>If you specify a column width and the contents of that column are longer than the specified width, your width setting is ignored. Think of it as a minimum width, not a maximum.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>If you omit a T-brace, tbl gets confused about your columns and might, for example, put column 2 in column 1. This plays havoc with your column width. You might not even see column 2 if this happens. Don't worry; column 2 isn't lost. It simply printed 

somewhere out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. When you fix your table, it will come back and behave.

<P>tbl is one of the most used, yet least liked programs, offered by the UNIX system. It is well worth the effort to learn at least the rudiments of tbl, because you can use tables to your advantage in unexpected situations. You can also make friends and 
influence supervisors if you take the time to learn tbl thoroughly. A good tbl debugger is hard to find.
