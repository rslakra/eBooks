She attended New York University where she studied French literature and picked up a couple of degrees. When this failed to produce splendid job offers, she turned 

to computers (big, blue, room-sized machines, sporting 30 KB of memory).

<BR></P>

<P>Today, 30 years later, she confines her computer-related activities to writing on and about them and playing games. She is a documentation consultant (technical writer) and lives in New Jersey with a horrible black dog, an innocuous grey cat, 
and&#151;between semesters&#151;varying configurations of her children. She and UNIX met in 1985 and have been living together happily ever since.

While at Rutgers, he was exposed to both analog and digital computers. He went to work for Electronic 

Associates, Inc., Princeton, New Jersey on leaving Rutgers. EAI was the world's largest manufacturer of analog and hybrid computers.

<BR></P>

<P>He later joined Mercer College, Trenton, New Jersey in 1970 as associate professor of electrical engineering and was given responsibility for the PDP-8/I lab. He was instrumental in bringing microcomputers to the campus in 1981; these were used in 
electronics engineering technology education. Currently, he is systems administrator for the college's UNIX lab, consultant to the college's Academic Computing Committee, secretary of the college's LAN Computing Committee, advisor to the Educational 
Technology Users Group for faculty and staff, and coordinator for electronics curricula.

<BR></P>

<P>Pete has authored a textbook on C for electronics engineering technology for Macmillan and a book on UNIX tools for Macmillan Computer Publishing. He has written invited chapters in a number of MCP books, and has been the technical editor or technical 
reviewer for many of MCP's UNIX book offerings.

<BR></P>

<P>Pete lives in Ewing, New Jersey with his wife, Cathy Ann Vandegrift and their four computers. They sail and enjoy the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra. Pete has a private pilot's license and is an avid autocross racer and tennis hacker. Cathy is a Realtor.

<P>Given life by Turing Award winning Bell Labs computer scientist Ken Thompson at Murray Hill, N.J., in August 1969, UNIX spent its early years as a research curiosity. When I met up with Unix in the summer of '82, however, it already possessed the one 
characteristic that destined it to dominate a major chunk of the world's market for operating systems&#151;portability. UNIX kicked off the era of open systems, the first wholesale paradigm shift in the history of computing, by being the first portable 
operating system.

<BR></P>

<P>Portability is so crucial because it symbolizes everything that open systems is about, and is the critical computing ingredient for the Information Age. You may hear people use the word primarily to talk about their applications that can run on more 
than one type of computer platform, but, at its highest level of abstraction, portability is much more. When you think about using standard network interfaces to pass data between different computers, that's portability of information; running applications 

across a range of devices from desktop to mainframe&#151;or even supercomputer&#151;is portability across scale; and the ability to swap out old technology for the latest technical advances without dramatically affecting the rest of your installation is 
portability through time. All this is necessary to support the extremely sophisticated levels of information malieability that corporations need to make the Information Age really work.

<BR></P>

<P>UNIX was always technically cool, advanced, insanely great, etc. So cool that Bell Labs began giving it away to colleges and universities in 1975 because they thought it would be a good recruitment tool&#151;they believed graduate computer engineers 
would want to work at the place that produced such an elegant piece of technology. But UNIX's all-important portability didn't come about until 1977. Before that, UNIX's technical qualities alone had lured many Bell operating company department heads to 
Murray Hill, where they learned about UNIX from its small team of creators and began deploying it on Digital Equipment Corporation computers throughout the Bell System. By 1977, AT&amp;T found itself buying a much larger percentage of Digital's annual 
output than seemed comfortable. (AT&amp;T didn't want to be responsible for a precipitous drop in Digital's fortunes if it had to stop buying for any reason.) So that year, UNIX's creators ported UNIX  for the first time, to a non-Digital computer whose 
only significant characteristic was that it was a non-Digital computer.

<BR></P>

<P>After that, UNIX was portable, and entrepreneurs ported it to new microcomputers like crazy. That's when I came on the scene, as a computer industry news reporter covering all that entrepreneurial energy. Even in 1982, the manifest destiny felt by the 
people in the UNIX  industry was clear. And the idea of a common operating system atop different hardware platforms so powerfully fired the imaginations of information systems managers in major corporations that, today, UNIX has become their de facto 
server operating system.

<BR></P>

<P>Given that you've purchased or are considering this book, you already know that UNIX  is ubiquitous. What UNIX is not, however&#151;even with the modern graphical user interfaces that paint a pretty face on it&#151;is easy to program or administer 
compared to DOS or NetWare. Just as a 747 is a bit more complicated to run than, say, a glider, UNIX's increased flexibility and power come with the price of greater complexity.

<BR></P>

<P>This book, which delves deeply into the underpinnings of UNIX systems and offers detailed information on many different brands of UNIX , can be your first step on an enjoyable journey into the powerful, technically elegant world of open, portable 
computing.
