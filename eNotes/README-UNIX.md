## What's an Operating System?

An operating system (OS) is a software program designed to act as an interface,
between a user and a computer. It controls a computer hardware, manages system 
resources, and supervises the interactions between the system and its users. The
operating system also forms a base on which application software is developed 
and executed.

## Functions of an Operating System?
An operating system is expected to perform various functions. these functions can
be broadly categorized as:

- Command Interpretation
  
  The CPU cannot understand the commands keys in by the user. It is the function of the OS to translate these commands into a language that the CPU understands.

- Peripheral Management

  The OS also has to take care of the devices (peripherals) attached to the system communication between these devices and the CPU is overseen by the OS.
  
- Memory Management

  The OS handles the extremely important job of allocating memory for the various process running on the system. It also has to clean up after a process - dispose off left over data in memory.

- Process Management
  
  This is required if several programs have to run concurrently. CPU time would then have to be rationed out by the OS to ensure that no program gets more than its fair share of CPU time.


## Types of Operating System

How an operating system works, depends to a great extent on the computer system on which it resides. As there are two basic kinds of computer system - single user and multi-user. These are the only two kinds of operating systems. DOS is the most popular example of a single-user OS.

A multi-user operating system handles multiple-users as well as multiple peripheral devices simultaneously. Such an operating system is more efficient and more sophisticated than single-user operating system.

Multi-user systems are required when a number of programs have to be run simultaneously, or common resources like printers and disks are to be shared by a number of users.

## Features and Benefits of UNIX

The UNIX operating system is available on machines with a wide range of computing powers, from microcomputers to mainframes, and on different machines. The populating and success of unix is due to the following reasons:

- Portability

  The system is written in a high-level language making it easier to read, understand, change and therefore move to other machines. The code can be changed and compiled on a new machine. customers can then choose from a wide variety of hardware vendors without being locked in with a particular vendor.

- Machine-independence

  The system hides the machine architecture from the user, making it easier to write applications that can run on micros, minis and mainframes.

- Mutli-user Operations

  Unix is a multi-user system designed to support a group of users simultaneously. The system allows for the sharing of processing power and peripheral resources, while at the same time providing excellent security features.

- Hierarchical File System

  Unix uses a hierarchical file structure to store information. It allows for easy maintenance and efficient implementation.

- UNIX Shell

  Unix has a simple user interface called the shell that has the power to provide the services that the user wants. It protects the user from having to know the intricate hardware details.

- Pipes and Filters

  Unix has facilities called pipes and filters, which permits the user to create complex programs from simple programs.

- Utilities
  
  Unix has over 200 utility programs for various functions. New utilities can be built effortlessly by combining existing utilities.

- Background Processing

  Unix has a facility by which the user can start a process and then proceed to work on other processes while the system runs the first process in the background and the second process in the foreground. Background processing helps the user in effective utilization of time.

- Software Development Tools

  Unix offers an excellent variety of tools for software development for all phases, from program editing to maintenance of software.

- Maturity

  Unix is a time-testing operating system. It offers a bug free environment and a high-level of reliability.

The unix system supports a wide verity of languages - C, Fortran, Pascal, ADA, COBOL, C++ etc.
