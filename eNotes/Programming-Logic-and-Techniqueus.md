## What's the problem-solving?

Problem-solving is an intricate process require much thought, careful planning,
logical precision and attention to details.

- What steps are involved in problem-solving?
  
    - Gathering the relevant data (Input)
    - Process the gathered information. (Process)
    - Concluding the result. (Output)

That is all a computer needs to solve a problem. It also follows the same above 
mentioned steps. It results some output after processing the provided information.

## What's a program?

A  set of instructions to solve a problem is termed as an algorithm. Algorithms can 
be expressed in different ways, for example, by drawing flow charts, using specific 
symbols or writing  the solution as a set of instructions in simple english. The 
later solution is called Pseudocode.

A program can be defined as an algorithm written in a programming language.

The sample program is used to explain the various components of any program and the 
process logic. Such programs are known as pseudocode. 

Let us have a look at an example:
