# AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)

---
```AJAX``` is an acronym for ```Asynchronous JavaScript And XML```.

AJAX is not a programming language, but simply a development technique for creating interactive web applications.

AJAX uses JavaScript to send and receive data between a web browser and a web server.
The AJAX technique makes web pages more responsive by exchanging data with a server behind the scenes, instead of reloading an entire web page each time a user makes a change.

With AJAX, web applications can be faster, more interactive, and more user-friendly.

AJAX uses an ```XMLHTTPRequest``` object to send data to a web server, and XML is commonly used as the format for receiving server data, although any format, including plain text, can be used.
