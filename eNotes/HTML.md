# HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

---
```HTML``` stands for ```Hypertext Markup Language```.

It is a simple text formatting language used to create hypertext documents. It is a platform independent language unlike most other programming languages. HTML is being platform independent needs to tell the interpreter. The browser formats the documents, and displays it on the user’s screen.

The ancestor of HTML is ```SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language)```. SGML was developed by ISO and was first used by the US ```DoD (Department of Defense)```. HTML came into existence in 1990. The development of HTML was initiated by ```Tim Berners – Lee``` and a team of other volunteers. SGML and HTML have a parent-child relationship. HTML has been in use on the ```WWW (World Wide Web)``` since its origin in 1990 and has gained popularity to the extent of becoming a standard on the WWW.

It provides a number of tags that can be used to place and format text, pictures and sound on web pages. These formatting tags are placed around text or pictures in a document. They specify how an object in a web page is to be displayed.

A web browser is a program that automatically interprets the HTML code and formats the document accordingly. This process of interpreting the commands and displaying a web page appropriately is known as rendering.

Tags are enclosed in angular brackets: <tags> i.e. ```<HTML>```. Tags are case-insensitive. Most tags come in paris, also known as containers, because they mark the beginning and ending of elements. Some tags are single entries, for example ```<HR>``` also called empty tags.
