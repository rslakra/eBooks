Welcome to ABC Pronunciary, an American English pronunciation dictionary. It is set up to teach clear and effective pronunciation of the English language. All of the letters of the English alphabet are introduced here. Since some of the letters have several sounds, especially the vowels, each sound is given its own name, such as long A, hard C, or "schwa" E. In addition to the vowels and consonants, digraphs, which are 2 consecutive letters forming a single sound when spoken together are included. For each sound the mouth formation is described in detail, then examples of words containing that sound are articulated. After all of the sounds have been presented, consonant blends and silent letters are explained. At the end vowel contrasts and consonant contrasts as well as practice sentences are offered for reinforcement. Learning to speak English correctly is made easy in ABC Pronunciary. Listen carefully!
