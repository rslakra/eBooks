# eBooks
This repository contains all my electornic books, which are categorized based on the programming languages and usability. It might be some of the books have copyright as all these are downloaded from the public links (and owner of those books, can send email to remove that book from this repository and I'll remove that one) and for personal learning only, so if anyone either downloads or uses this repository AS IT IS with their own responsibility.
